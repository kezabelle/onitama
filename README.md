### [Rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160477/onitama/files) for an [Onitama](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160477/onitama) card.

- 5x5 grid
- base movement square is always square 13, counting from any corner.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | - | @ | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |

- from the base movement square, one or more of the 8 surrounding squares must be a valid move position.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

| - | # | # | # | - |
| - | # | @ | # | - |

| - | - | - | - | - |

- cards are coloured:
  - red cards are offensive-right
  - blue cards are offensive-left
  - green cards are symmetrical.
- cards have 3 or 4 valid move positions.
  - with the exception of tiger, which only has 2.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | # | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | - | @ | - | - |
| - | - | # | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |

- tiger and crab both "skip" a square horitontally or vertically from the base movement square,
  but crab is less offensive (sideways movement) so gets a 3rd valid move.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

- mirrors are:
  - ox = horse
  - goose = rooster
  - mantis = crane
  - rabbit = frog
  - eel = cobra
  - [promo cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/195556/onitama-dice-tower-2016-promo-tiles): turtle = phoenix
- rabit and frog can, like crab, move 2 squares horizontally, skipping the one closest to the base movement square,
  but they are offensively sided diagonal movers, where crab is symmetrical.
  - like crab, they get 3 moves. Unlike tiger.
- dragon can swoop to the edge of the board, like crab and tiger, but not in a cardinal direction from the base movement square.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|

- dragon, crab and tiger are the only cards capable of hitting one of the outer squares/board edges when on the actual base movement square.
- the only cards where movement follows a "path" of consecutive squares are:
  - elephant
  - goose
  - rooster
- thus there is never a consecutive path or train of movement that is 3 squares or more, like the following:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | # | # | - |
| - | - | # | - | - |
| - | - | @ | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |

- but a path of 2 consecutive would be OK .. though this might be too powerful (see tiger)

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | # | - | - |
| - | - | # | - | - |
| - | - | @ | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |

- pawns may move through occupied spaces as long as the chosen square is either empty, or the pawn is going
  to take an opposing piece. This is specific to the consecutive path cards (elephant, goose, tiger).
  In the below card (goose), I, as the blue (B) player, can move to any of the letters (B, R). Moving
  to either of the "R" squares would have me take an enemy red (R) piece, but I can move to either "B" position without
  taking a piece:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | B | - | - | - |
| - | R | @ | R | - |
| - | - | - | B | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |

- with the exception of the tiger, dragon and turtle (promo card), all cards must have at least one offensive move forward, using
  one of these squares:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | # | # | # | - |
| - | - | @ | - | - |
