### Rules for an onitama card.

- 5x5 grid
- base movement square is always square 13, counting from any corner.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|

- from the base movement square, one or more of the 8 surrounding squares must be a valid move position.

- cards are coloured:
  - red cards are offensive-right
  - blue cards are offensive-left
  - green cards are symmetrical.
- cards have 3 or 4 valid move positions.
  - with the exception of tiger, which only has 2.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

- tiger and crab both "skip" a square horitontally or vertically from the base movement square,
  but crab is less offensive (sideways movement) so gets a 3rd valid move.

- mirrors are:
  - ox = horse
  - goose = rooster
  - mantis = crane
  - rabbit = frog
  - eel = cobra
  - **promo cards** turtle = phoenix
- rabit and frog can, like crab, move 2 squares horizontally, skipping the one closest to the base movement square,
  but they are offensively sided diagonal movers, where crab is symmetrical.
  - like crab, they get 3 moves. Unlike tiger.
- dragon can swoop to the edge of the board, like crab and tiger, but not in a cardinal direction from the base movement square.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

- dragon, crab and tiger are the only cards capable of hitting one of the outer squares/board edges when on the actual base movement square.
- the only cards where movement follows a "path" of consecutive squares are:
  - elephant
  - goose
  - rooster
- thus there is never a consecutive path or train of movement that is 3 squares or more, like the following:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | # | # | - |
| - | - | # | - | - |
| - | - | @ | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - |

- but a path of 2 consecutive would be OK .. though this might be too powerful (see tiger)
